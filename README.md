A countdown app using countdown.js and React 17, js, css, and html.
This is still a work in progress. I am making this for my kids to use, so it's not very fancy.

To get the app running after 'npm install' and npm update',
run `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.
